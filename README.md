# Advent of Code Solutions üéÑ‚ú®

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions for the **Advent of Code** challenges. Each solution represents a unique programming exercise designed to tackle algorithmic and computational problems across various topics such as string manipulation, data structures, dynamic programming, and more.

The goal of this project is to practice and improve problem-solving skills while having fun with these engaging puzzles!

## Project Details

This repository is organized by day, with each day corresponding to a specific puzzle released during the Advent of Code event. The solutions are implemented in my chosen programming language(s) and aim to be efficient and well-documented.

---

### Example of Solution Structure:

Each day's folder contains:
- **`input.txt`**: The puzzle input for the specific day.
- **`solution.[language]`**: The code for solving the puzzle.
- **`README.md` (optional)**: Additional notes or explanations about the approach used to solve the problem.
